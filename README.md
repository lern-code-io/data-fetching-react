# data-fetching
Extend the App component to fetch an array of posts from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'. You should fetch the posts onMount of the component and put the data in the 'posts' state which has been created for you. If done sucessfully, you should see a list of posts appear in the DOM.
